// Practice Question:

// Write a Java program that defines a Car class, which represents a simple car. The Car class should include the following:

//     Fields:
//         int speed - to store the speed of the car (default 0).
//         String gearType - to store the type of gear the car is currently in (default "P" for Park).

//     Methods:
//         void changeGear(String newGear) - sets the gear to the given value.
//         void accelerate(int increment) - increases the speed by the specified amount.
//         void brake(int decrement) - decreases the speed by the specified amount.
//         void printState() - prints the current speed and gear type.

//     Write a CarDemo class with a main method that:
//         Creates two different Car objects.
//         Invokes the methods on each car object to simulate driving. For example:
//             Change the gear.
//             Accelerate.
//             Apply brakes.
//             Print the state of each car after the operations.

// Requirements:

//     You should implement the Car class and the CarDemo class.
//     Each car should have different sets of actions to demonstrate how the methods interact with the fields.

// Example Output (for reference, not exact):

// Car 1 -> Speed: 30, Gear: D
// Car 2 -> Speed: 20, Gear: R
